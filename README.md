# Used_Cars_Price_Prediction_Model
Here, I have made a model which uses Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the prices of a used car considering the different features like how old the car is, power, mileage, fuel type, kilometers driven, and whether the car is automatic or manual.

Using different libraries like NumPy, pandas, seaborn
Plotted graphs between various features and oversaw the trend in the change of price.
After which, we divided the dataset into training and test set and applied the algorithms.
I have used three algorithms  Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Regressor to predict the prices and finally achieved an accuracy of 92% using the Random Forest Regressor.
