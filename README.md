# Used_Cars_Price_Prediction_Model
Here I have made a model which is used to predict the prices of used car using differnt features like the year in which it was bought, the engine, power, milage, fuel type also if the car is automatic manual.

I have used 3 algorithms to use and got finally achieved an accuracy of 92% using the Random Forest Regressor.
